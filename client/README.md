This folder contains all the source code for the official Primrose front-end client, written completely in SvelteKit 
and Tailwind with the use of Tanstack Query.

We recommend using Cloudflare Pages, or Vercel to host this front-end client. Remember to configure the `.env` file 
before hosting it.
