#### 

Primrose  is *simple and open-source* personal blog platform built from scratch with **Golang**, **Svelte and  Tailwind**. It is 
designed to the successor to [`Flora`](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Flora) with a more open-ended backend that would 
enable us to switch front-end clients easier in the far future.

Unlike [`Flora`](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Flora), Primrose is designed to have users which means that comments 
and other related features will be implementable, which is already on the timeline to be developed as of writing.

#### Landscape
1. [`core`](core) contains the core backend source code, written in Golang and powered by MongoDB.
2. [`client`](client) contains the frontend source code, written in SvelteKit with Tailwind.

#### Ideology

Primrose is designed to be a personal blog site, therefore, editors and other administrators are not considered in the 
development of the application. Although, if requested by many, considerations might be made to implement some form of 
role-based access to the creator page.
